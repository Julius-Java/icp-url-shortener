# URL Shortener - Internet Computer

A URL shortening service built on the Internet Computer platform. This application allows users to create shortened URLs and redirect to their original destinations.

## Features

- Create shortened URLs from long URLs
- Copy shortened URLs to clipboard
- Automatic redirection from short URLs to original URLs
- Built on Internet Computer's decentralized infrastructure

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Motoko (Internet Computer)
- UI Components: Shadcn UI
- State Management: React Hooks

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Start the local replica:
```bash
dfx start --background
```

3. Deploy the canisters:
```bash
dfx deploy
```

4. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
